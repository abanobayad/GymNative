                            The deltoid muscle is the main muscle of the shoulder. It consists of three muscle heads: the anterior deltoid, lateral deltoid, and posterior deltoid. All assist with arm elevation during a process called glenohumeral elevation and play a large role in the movement and overall stability of the shoulder joint and upper arm. The entire deltoid muscle spans from the spine of the scapula to the lateral portion of the clavicle.
                            <img style="width: 20%; float: right ; display: block; margin: 50px; "src="images/workout/Content/shoulderantonamy.png">

                             Each head of the deltoid has slightly different insertion points, allowing for more control and a full range of motion at the shoulder joint. The anterior head of the deltoid works closely with pectoralis major, which allows for full stabilization near its more superior insertion on the clavicle.<br>
                            When each of the deltoid's three heads contracts together, it allows the arm to be elevated, or abducted, the first 15 degrees away from the body. This then triggers the remainder of the glenohumeral joint to assist with stabilizing the shoulder and contracting additional muscles to provide the remainder of the arc of motion. <br><br>
                            <strong> The anterior deltoid </strong> rotates the shoulder joint medially by drawing the arm inward. This flexion and  medial rotation allow the arm to move forward, sometimes referred to as forward flexion. This action can be seen in a  variety of functional tasks and is quite integral to upper extremity movement. The forward-flexed motion moves the arm toward the insertion point of the anterior deltoid at the clavicle.<br><br>
                                                        <span class="dots" id="dots">.....</span><span class="more" id="more">
                            <strong>The lateral deltoid</strong> rotates the shoulder joint laterally moving the arm outward, referred to as abduction. This is important while walking, reaching, and completing many other tasks ina lateral plane. This abduction moves the shoulder joint downward to accommodate for the movement of the entire arm outward. The contraction of the lateral deltoid pushes the arm toward the insertion point of the lateral deltoid, which is on the proximal humerus.<br><br>
                            <strong>The posterior deltoid </strong> rotates the joint laterally which moves the arm backward and outward. This moves the entire arm toward the spine, which is where this head of the deltoid inserts. This motion is seen often when dressing, reaching backward, or throwing, among other functional tasks.<br>

                            <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder; display: block;">  **Focus On Form sAnd Feel For Lateral Raises </span>
                            Some movements are meant for heavy weights, for pushing or pulling a load from point A to point B. In the realm of deltoid exercises, overhead presses fit that description. You're not trying to isolate anything. If your form is decent, you're good to go. Presses are tough to screw up.<br><br>
                            Lateral raises, on the other hand, are not power movements and not suited to heavy weights. Think of them more as finesse movements, designed to isolate a particular aspect of a muscle. But lateral raises are pointless if you use momentum and other supporting muscles to raise the weights. If you do those kinds of cheats, you won't be able to feel your medial deltoids firing and contracting, which is where the growth comes from.<br><br>
                            Instead of cheating the weights up, lift them explosively, hold them for a splitsecond pause at the top, and control them as you slowly lower them down. You can't practice this ideal form if you're trying to lift too much, so go light and pay close attention to your movement pattern. And don't worry, no one is ever going to ask you how much you use on lateral raises. Do laterals right, though, and people will ask, "Wow, what do you do for your shoulders?"<br>

                            You may feel tempted to add front-delt work into this program—and maybe bypass your rear delts altogether. Who cares about rear delts, right? It's those side delts that give you that roundness and width! Well, that might be true if you were a two-dimensional paper cutout, but we exist in 3-D. If you want impressive shoulders that are round and full from every angle, you need to work all three heads of the deltoid muscles.

                            Before we discuss the best exercises for the legs, let's look at their anatomy. <br>


                        <div class="musTitle2" style="width: 15%;"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 30px;" >U</span>pper Legs</div>
                            The upper leg (thigh) is comprised of the quadriceps, the hamstrings, and the
                            glutes as the main muscle groups<br>
                            


                        <div class="musTitle2"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 30px; width: 25%;">Q</span>uads</div>
                            The quadriceps looks like this:<br>
                            <img src="images/workout/Content/leg1.png" style="width: 50%; padding-left:250px;
                            display: block; margin: 50px; border-radius: 30px;"><span class="dots" id="dots1">.....</span><span class="more" id="more1">
                            The quadriceps consists of the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the vastus
                            intermedius, and the vastus medialis. The quads are responsible for extending
                            your leg, which is also known as adduction.<br>
                            The vastus medialis is the teardrop muscle that bodybuilders develop quite well.
                            It can be trained the best with unilateral (one-legged) exercises such as split
                            squats and lunges and it also responds very well to squatting past parallel.
                            
                             <hr style="width: 300px;"> 
    
                        <div class="musTitle2"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 32px">H</span>amstrings</div>
                            The hamstrings, or biceps femoris, are the muscle group that makes up the back
                            of your thighs. The hamstrings are responsible for flexing the leg, which is also
                            known as abduction.<br>
                            The hamstrings are comprised of a long and short head, very similar to the biceps.
                            Most exercises that hit the hamstrings, except for leg curls, will hit the glutes
                            (Gluteus Maximus and Minimus) as well.<br>
                            The hamstrings can be trained in a variety of ways—including Snatch-Grip and
                            Stiff-Legged Deadlifts, Leg Curls, and Glute-Ham Raises. Make sure that you train
                            your hamstrings as much as you train your quadriceps to ensure a healthy balance
                            of leg development.<br>
                            

                        <div class="musTitle2"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 28px">G</span>lutes</div>
                            The glutes (Gluteus Maximus and Minimus) are activated in almost all leg
                            exercises and are one the strongest muscle groups in the body. Developing your
                            glutes will go a long way for increases in strength.<br>
                                 <hr style="width: 300px;"> 
    
                        <div class="musTitle2" style="width: 16%;"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 32px">L</span>ower Legs</div>

                            The calves make up most of the lower leg and consist of the Gastrocnemius and
                            Soleus. Standing calf raises target the Gastrocnemius and seated calf raises target
                            the Soleus. Another item to note is that the Gastrocnemius is primarily fast-twitch
                            while the Soleus is primarily slow-twitch.
                            I personally don't train calves until late in the off-season but having a big set
                            calves can be very impressive for a bodybuilder to say the least. If you do enough
                            running and/or Plyometrics, however, you should be fine in terms of calf
                            development.<br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px;">**What Exercises Should You Perform For Maximum Leg Growth?</strong><br><br>
                            For maximum leg growth, the primary exercise should be the full back squat. No
                            other lift even comes closes to the muscle fiber activation created by squatting.
                            Squatting also increases the amount of growth hormone the body releases.
                            An increase in growth hormone will not only increase leg size but you will have
                            more full-body hypertrophy as well. Full back squats hit all the quadriceps
                            muscles, the hamstrings, and the glutes which is why they are the king of all
                            exercises.<br>
                            However, squatting for the whole year might put too much pressure on the spine.
                            A few spine deloading cycles should be implemented throughout the year to
                            prevent this.<br>
                            For example, unilateral exercises can be used instead. That issue aside, here are
                            the top exercises for complete leg development:

                        The biceps is a large muscle situated on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder
                        and the elbow. Also known by the Latin name biceps brachii (meaning "two-headed muscle
                        of the arm"), the muscle's primary function is to flex the elbow and rotate the forearm. The
                        heads of the muscle arise from the scapula (shoulder blade) and combine in the middle arm
                        to form a muscle mass. The other end attaches to the radius, the outermost of the two
                        bones that make up the forearm.<br><br>

                    The biceps is one of four muscles alongside the brachialis, brachioradialis, and
                    coracobrachialis muscles that make up the upper arm.
                    The biceps muscle is comprised of two heads. At each end are connective tissues called
                    tendons that anchor the muscles to bone.<br><br><br>

                    <strong style="font-size: 22px;">•The long head </strong>originates from a cavity in the scapula called the glenoid. It passes
                    through the shoulder joint to the upper arm through a groove in the humerus (the
                    large bone of the upper arm).<br><br>
                    <strong>• The short head </strong> originates from a projection on the scapula called the coracoid and runs alongside the long head on the inside of the arm.<br><br>
                    The two heads join in the middle arm to form a combined muscle belly. Although the heads
                    work in tandem to move the forearm, they are anatomically distinct, with no conjoined
                    fibers.<br>

                    As the heads extend downward toward the elbow, they rotate 90 degrees and attach to a
                    rough projection just beneath the neck of the radius called the radial tuberosity.
                    Of the other three muscles that make up the upper arm, the biceps is the only one to cross
                    two joints: the elbow joint and the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint.<br>
                    
                         <hr style="width: 300px;">

                    Despite what some think, the biceps is not the most powerful flexor of the forearm.
                    Although the biceps is the most prominent muscle of the upper arm, it serves to support
                    and stabilize the deeper (and stronger) brachialis muscle whenever lifting or lowering the
                    forearm. <br><br>
                    The main functions of the biceps are the flexion and supination (outward rotation) of the
                    forearm. This is facilitated, in part, by the 90-degree rotation of the muscle as it connects to
                    the radius.<br><br>
                    As the biceps muscle contracts, it can do one of two things (or both together):<br><br><br>
                    • Aid the brachialis in the flexions (lifting) of the forearm<br><br>
                    • Aid the supinator muscle (which starts at the outer elbow and ends at the inner<br><br>
                    wrist) in rotating the forearm upward<br><br>
                    Although the supination of the forearm involves the biceps, pronation (in which the palm is
                    turned downward) is facilitated by the brachialis and corresponding pronator muscles.<br><br>
                    The biceps also weakly assists with arm movements at the glenohumeral joint, including
                    forward flexion (lifting the entire arm forward), abduction (opening the arm to the side),
                    and adduction (folding the arm across the body).<br><br>
                    The small head of the biceps is important in stabilizing the scapula, allowing us to carry
                    heavy weights when the arm is in an extended downward position.<br><br>

                        The triceps brachii is the muscle that runs down the back of the humerus [1] , which is the
                        long bone of the upper arm, and ends at the top of the ulna, which is the long bone of
                        the forearm.<br><br>
                        The triceps brachii gets its name because it contains three muscle 'heads' or points of
                        origin. These include the:<br>
                    <ul>    
                        <li>Medial head</li>
                        <li>Lateral head</li>
                        <li>Long head</li>
                    </ul>

                        • It helps in extension of the elbow joint and also acts as an antagonist of the
                        biceps and brachialis.<br><br>
                        • The triceps brachii also helps to stabilize the shoulder by keeping the head of the
                        humerus in its correct position in the shoulder joint.<br><br>
                        • Muscle histology and average innervation ratios estimated from absolute
                        mononeurons (MN) counts showed that the medial head was predominantly
                        formed by small type I fibers and motor units (69 fibers/MN). In contrast, the
                        lateral fascicle comprised a great quantity of large type IIb fibers and motor units
                        (179 fibers/MN), whereas the long head consisted of a more balanced mixture of
                        fiber types and motor units (99 fibers/MN). [6] Therefore the lateral head is used
                        for movements requiring occasional high-intensity force, while the medial head
                        enables more precise, low-force movements.<br><br>
                        • When the shoulder is internally rotated, the ability of the long head of the triceps
                        brachii to extend and adduct the shoulder is diminished. The shoulder must be
                        externally rotated in order for the long head of the triceps brachii to assist
                        shoulder adduction.<br><br>

                    <strong>Use good form until you can't</strong>. Ironically, using both bad and good form can limit
                            your gains.You can get the best of both worlds by using strict form in the first part
                            of your sets, then loosening it up once you can no longer complete any reps in
                            perfect form. In this approach, you're using "cheat reps" to extend the set past
                            the limiting point of good from. As a result, you have a chance to work the
                            muscles harder.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Lift quickly and lower slowly.</strong> To get the most from each rep, first do the
                            concentric or lifting phase of the rep with explosive force to recruit high-threshold
                            muscle fibers that have the highest potential for growth. Once you reach the
                            midpoint of the exercise, squeeze or contract the muscle. As you do the eccentric,
                            or lowering, phase, move the weight very slowly back into the starting position to
                            increase the muscle's time under tension. Lifting quickly and lowering slowly, with
                            a squeeze in between, has been shown to provide maximum muscle-growth
                            stimulation.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Eat and sleep well.</strong> Muscle growth does not occur in a vacuum. No matter how
                            hard you train, your nutrition must support that growth. You need a steady supply
                            of protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and water, consuming them every 2-3
                            hours of every waking moment in your day. Make sure your meals before and
                            after workouts are rich in carbohydrates, so your muscles have glycogen to fuel
                            the contractions and pumps, and to replace that glycogen you used for fuel during
                            the workout. Also arrange your day to get the sleep you need. Everyone needs a
                            different amount of sleep to function at their best.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Treat every workout like a last chance.</strong> Halfway efforts yield halfway results, so
                            apply your full concentration and intensity into every rep of every set you do in
                            the coming 10 weeks. Unless you're a parent of a young child or have a job that
                            requires you to be on call at all times, keep your smartphone in your locker while
                            you train. Don't get into socializing; get to work.<br><br>
                    <strong>Give your arms no choice.</strong> Ten weeks is not a long time in the grand scheme of
                            things. It's certainly not much time to cause substantial muscle growth—under
                            typical circumstances, that is. That's why you're about to embark on a program
                            that hits your arms in ways they aren't accustomed to, with more volume and
                            greater frequency combined with different rep ranges and styles of tension. Faced
                            with these kinds of stimulation, your arms will have no choice but to grow!<br><br>

                        side of your back and helps you extend, rotate, and pull your arms toward your body. The
                        erector spinae is made up of three muscles that run the length of your back from your neck
                        to your fanny. The erector spinae is involved in flexion and extension of the upper body, as
                        well as rotation.<br><br>
                        There are also muscles known as your "posture" muscles. These are the rhomboids (major
                        and minor) and they are located between the shoulder blades and aid in rotation, elevation,
                        and retraction of the shoulder blades.<br><br>

      <div class="musTitle2" style="width: 40%;"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 40px">W</span>hy Work Out Your Back</div>
                        Your back muscles are involved in just about every activity you do each day, so it is
                        important that they're strong enough to handle all that work. Strength training your back
                        muscles will add muscle mass to your upper body, which can help make your waist look
                        smaller. Like your chest, your back is made up of big muscles that can handle heavyweight
                        and, therefore, help you burn more calories.<br><br>

                        You can work your chest up to three non-consecutive days a week. However, if you're lifting
                        heavy weights (enough that you can only complete six to eight repetitions), you'll need at
                        least two to three days of rest before you perform the exercises again. For this reason, you
                        may only want to work your chest once or twice a week. <br><br>

      <div class="musTitle2"  style="width: 30%;"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 40px">H</span>ow Often to Train</div>
                        Like all muscles in your body, you can perform back exercises up to three non-consecutive
                        days a week. If you're lifting heavy weights — enough that you can only complete six to
                        eight repetitions — you'll need two or more days of rest before you perform the exercise
                        again. For this reason, you might only work your back once or twice a week.<br><br>
                        However, if your goal is to gain endurance and strength, stick with one to three sets of 12-
                        16 repetitions lifting a weight that fatigues your muscle in that rep range. If this is the case,
                        you will want to make sure that you take at least one day of rest before you perform the
                        exercises again. Doing more and not allowing your body to heal after workouts can lead to
                        overtraining, which will eventually negate any training gains you make.<br><br>

                        The chest muscles are made up of the pectoralis major and, underneath that, the pectoralis
                        minor. <br><br>
                        Together they are often referred to as the "pecs." The pectoralis major is the larger muscle and has
                        two parts—an upper portion (called the clavicular head) and the lower portion (called the sternal
                        head). The pectoralis minor is triangular in shape and works in tandem with the pectoralis major.<br><br>
                        The chest muscles are responsible for moving the arms across the body and up and down, as
                        well as other movements like flexion, adduction, and rotation. Most chest exercises involve
                        pushing the arms away from the body or the body away from the arms.<br><br>

                        The chest includes some of the largest muscles in the upper body and you use the chest
                        muscles all day long. For example, the chest muscles are needed to push open a door, wash
                        your hair, or get up and down from the floor. It's important to keep these muscles strong for
                        all your daily activities.<br><br>
                        You also use the pecs in many common exercises, such as the pushup. Your chest muscles
                        are big and can handle more weight, which allows you to burn more calories when you
                        exercise them. In fact, when you work your chest, your shoulders and arms are also
                        involved, allowing you to exercise more of your body at once. A chest workout also serves as
                        a great warmup for those smaller muscle groups.<br><br>

                        Working your chest muscles (or pecs) does more than simply improve your physique. These
                        key muscles are involved in essential functions you need throughout the day and provide
                        the foundation for many moves you need in a variety of exercises and athletics. Additionally,
                        the chest muscles are a large muscle group, so working them will warm you up for exercise
                        and help you to burn calories.

                        Some of the most common chest exercises include pushups, chest presses, and chest flies.
                        Choose a mixture of different exercises to target your chest from a variety of directions, and
                        make sure you vary your routine every four to six weeks to avoid plateaus. To augment your
                        workout, you can change exercises, increase weight, and/or add repetitions.<br><br>
                        If your aim is simply to get strong and fit, work your chest along with other muscle groups in
                        combination, as in an upper-body pyramid workout or a total-body workout. If you're trying
                        to build size, choose exercises that work your chest by itself with a variety of exercises, such
                        as incline press and parallel bar dips.<br><br>
                        <hr style="width: 300px;">
                        <br><br>
                              <div class="musTitle2"><span style="color: aqua ; font-size: 40px">V</span>ariations</div>

                        
                        
                        Slight adjustments in how you do an exercise can change which area of the chest is targeted.
                        For example, a chest press involves the entire pectoralis major with a focus on the lower
                        portion of the chest. By moving to an incline position, you still work the entire pectoralis
                        major, but now the focus shifts to the upper portion of the chest.<br><br>
                        By changing the movement, the angle, and/or the type of resistance, you'll recruit different
                        muscle fibers and challenge your body in new ways. That's why there are so many variations
                        for each exercise—and why it's worth doing a range of exercises, enabling you to work the
                        entire chest.
